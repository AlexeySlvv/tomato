# Potato: The "Package" You Don't Have to Install

## What is Potato?

**Potato** is the revolutionary new Python "package" that does absolutely nothing... except stop your code from running! And the best part? You don’t even have to install it. Python natively supports Potato, thanks to its strict variable naming rules.

Just type `potato` into your source code and watch the magic happen! Your script will immediately halt with a `NameError`, leaving your colleagues (or future self) wondering why there's a potato in your code.

## Why Potato?

- **Zero Dependencies**: Potato requires absolutely no installations or updates.
- **Lightweight**: Takes up 0 bytes of storage.
- **Instant Debugging**: Clearly marks the exact point in your code where Potato strikes.
- **Fun for Everyone**: Confuse your friends, co-workers, and even your future self with a randomly placed `potato`!

## Installation

There is no installation. Python comes with Potato pre-installed. Simply open your favorite Python script and start typing `potato`.

## Usage

### Example 1: Halting a Script
```python
print("Hello, world!")
potato
print("This will never run.")
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, world!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 2, in <module>
    potato
NameError: name 'potato' is not defined
```

### Example 2: Asserting Dominance in the Codebase
```python
if user_input == "42":
    print("You cracked the ultimate answer!")
else:
    potato
```

**Output:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 4, in <module>
    potato
NameError: name 'potato' is not defined
```

### Example 3: Leaving Easter Eggs
```python
# TODO: Replace potato with actual logic later
potato
```
